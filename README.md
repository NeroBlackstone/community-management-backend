### What is this Project?
It's my graduation project. A community information management system, just a simple CRUD CMS.  
Here is **BACKEND ONLY**. Frontend:[Here](https://github.com/NeroBlackstone/community-management-frontend)  
This is my first time writing a web project with Vue and GraphQL.(So I'm sorry if there are some errors.)  
But I'll try my best to get **Best Practices**.
